So, I'm starting the second semester in Epitech. Life is still good,
considering the extra load, but I'm getting into the meaty things and quite
enjoying the whole ordeal.

I took some time off during the BTTF weeks to get this site the way I wanted it
to, probably with some things still missing, like the sidebar that isn't quite
right, the useless (for now) categories, etc.  
But I'm leaving those for French class and other meetings.

I'm thinking of writing about some of the shenanigans we had thus far at
school, but there's a great deal many more interesting things to do. I've
started maintaining a personal wiki, keep all my mail backed up locally, have
Ansible running all well and good ([with my old in-need-ofrefactoring
playbook](https://github.com/alter2000/.dots), keep some sort of journal, and
hopefully will get by unscathed from spring feels. I'll have to start
encrypting and backing up more often though.
