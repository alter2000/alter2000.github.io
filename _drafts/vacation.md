# Vacation

It's 1 A.M. in the west of bumfuck nowhere, yet there are always people around.
Some even brought their ducks from home so they won't starve during their
holiday. Fret not, for no foul fowl shall feed from our food, as there is yet
another hellhound to cleanse the forest (read: someone else brought a tiny
malnourished dog that happens to know that ducks and chickens are rich in
protein so they will finally s~~h~~it in an enclosure). I seem to have
a complicated relationship with this place: I loved it once I came here, what
with all the cousins and free roaming and everything, and year after year the
very same people are becoming more and more of a nuisance, not to mention 3 new
additions to our household roster (my brother and my aunt's children), for
which I too have had to donate hours to the babysitting cause. I'm tired, I'm
hot, I miss my bed, and the cicadas do indeed give a fuck once doves start
hanging around (to whomever brought them, I salute you, just remember to grill
them before they lay eggs). Oh, and my phone seems to have crapped itself.
Nice, no reddit on my way home.

Still though, I feel like I'm constantly getting less and less emotional about
many things (which, of course, is a grave danger for quality
problem-sharing-but-never-solving time and I don't know how to get this out).
I've been doing fine without the nets for a while; it's actually easy, once you
clock down. The lunchtime heat is unbearable though, and there's nothing to
change my mind (maybe an A/C unit but these walls are meant to keep rodents and
some insects out, not air in). I should have installed Vim in here, not Atom.
Meh, fuck it. It's not like I'm going to change any words here. From now till
I lay hands upon a `*vi*` editor, I will be an insert-mode heathen.

I'll probably set up a private journal repo to shove this crap, but I'll need
to figure out a way to pull posts from over there into the blog in a separate
category, otherwise chances are it gets put *aside*. I'm planning on doing
a proper redesign, together with a domain name (fuck it, github has free
hosting and nothing has changed since the purchase; besides, I don't have any
money to vote with). Anyway, new domain, probably server time from an actual
data center, new services, new school, new lots.
