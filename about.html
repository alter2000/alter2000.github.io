This site is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> and uses <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. I’ll eventually self-host with my own domain, mail server and everything, but for now let’s keep expenses to a minimum. Expect infrequent posts and don’t hesitate to ask any kind of relevant questions<sup>®</sup>.
