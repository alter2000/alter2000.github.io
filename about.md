  GNU/Linux distributions and food.  </p>

  <p> This site is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and uses
  [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). I'll eventually self-host with my own domain,
  mail server and everything, but for now let's keep expenses to a minimum.
  Expect tutorials and don't hesitate to ask any kind of relevant questionsÂ®.</p>
