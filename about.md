I'm a tinkerer, FOSS enthusiast, DIY-er. I'm smitten with tiling WMs, rolling GNU/Linux distributions and food.

This site is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). I'll eventually self-host with my own domain,
mail server and everything, but for now let's keep expenses to a minimum.
Expect tutorials and don't hesitate to ask any kind of relevant questionsÂ®.
