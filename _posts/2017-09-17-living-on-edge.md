excerpt: "Or, \"How I had another epiphany\""

We all know technology has gone far enough for us to look at all the cats we
want to, help cure cancer and create cancerous communities, and more. Data
transfer and storage prices have dropped like eggs from my bicycle, while usage
naturally keeps increasing.

Some of us are unlucky enough to live on places the holy hand of 3G (not even
wired broadband) has yet to bless. Of course the natives have adapted, but my
habitat is quite different. I got to live for a month (and counting) with
barely any cell phone signal, and EDGE on that rare occasion. 3G was out of the
question, and the closest internet caf√© was roughly an hour off-road drive
away. Sure, jumping on the car when absolutely necessary is a viable option,
but I have neither a license nor a car. Hitching a ride? Sure, if there's any.
So I had to do what every human has to do: adapt <sup>*GASP*</sup>

The week before leaving I stocked up on entertainment of all sorts: music,
memes (I delegated this to a friend for the element of surprise), films, books,
offline games and some more practice exercises for the SAT. "I have 3 GB to
waste on Reddit and people," - I thought. It seems I should've thought about
the return trip and headphones breaking along the way.

## But how is carrier-limited data related to weak, slow connections?
For one, downloading images through EDGE connections is a pain, especially when
there's some sort of forest between the phone and the cell tower. The same
image download would need to be restarted more than once. Instant messaging is
no longer instant, just fast enough to create confusion for others and you have
to rely solely on linking the message you're referring to. Webmail? What is
this sorcery? Even text-only email is too much. Oh, and when you get home your
Arch laptops will have an update the size of a Windows 10 update waiting for
you.

### 1. Save stuff for later
Make a website scraper and store your memes for later, find books and manuals
you'd want to read and take one or two films/seasons on an SD card, download
a bunch of **offline** games and geocache files and find something a bit more
useful to do out there.

### 2. Don't surf
Spare yourself the pain of downloading whole pages and automate saving some of
them (especially useful when you have signal where you usually sleep). Use
something like [WebHTTrack](https://www.httrack.com/) or cook a script with
`wget` or `curl` And don't visit
[/r/youdontsurf](https://youdontsurf.reddit.com) even on 3G. If necessary, use
a **text-based** web browser. My go-to is ELinks, with Lynx a close second.
Pair it with your image viewer of choice and you're good to go (hint: graphs
don't scale well with ASCII art).

### 3. Be comfortable
Patience isn't endless, after all. Don't lie on your bed flinging your phone in
the air, hoping to get one last packet out of the connection, but don't sit on
branches or hot sand either. Roam around and find the places with the strongest
signal, map them as GPX waypoints (I usually pick -80dB and higher) and hope
the weather is on your side.

### 4. Forget about the world
You're disconnected and this situation is almost always only temporary. If
you're unlucky enough to live in this situation daily then all these tips are
probably second nature to you.

Find some other activity or explore a new hobby (offline, of course). Take
actual care of yourself, go walking or running or swimming or whatever, just
move. I have to say, this one was hard for me, mainly because of the scorching
sun. Walking around in a forest under the (arguably faint) moonlight isn't that
dangerous as long as you make noise and can tell where local predators may
live. Take care, even when going out at night in populated areas.

### 5. Have fun
Time flies when having fun. Just don't lock yourself up unintentionally.
