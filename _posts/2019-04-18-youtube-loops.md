Here's a funny pastime: find how many videos it takes to go back to the first video.

Extra: try it with different accounts.

Extra extra: keep track of the time watched and/or total video time.

Extra^3: use a VPN or, if you're broke and feeling statistically average, Tor.

Aside: my 'funny' is seldom 'haha' and more like 'oh wow' or 'I need an adult'.
