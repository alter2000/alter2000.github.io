As I said earlier, for now this page will only have homework.
It's still rough around the edges (pls don't go *anywhere else* until I tell you to), so expect changes.
If you're looking for walls of text, go somewhere else.


I'm not a fast writer, nor do I have the time to make something good enough for the world to see.
Every week we're going to have a decent-sized text to write, so that's my main content source for now.
This week's writing task is...

#### Expectations, goals, dreams and hopes for this academic year

A fairly common theme, it seems.
It is, actually.
Both this text *and* this site are tools to gauge my skills, so all I can do is go on, like the generic hard-working and zealous student I am to become.

I don't usually make plans for the distant future, but the present doesn't seem to care.
This summer I had an invitation from one of my dad's cousins to go to the US of A when I finish high school.

>I've always wanted to work the guts out of computers, big or small, mine or not (this has become the culprit for one too many frozen PCs).
>Growing up away from MS Paint, the one and only way of entertainment on Windows 95 for the older machines, I began my journey into the damned lands of `cmd`.<br>
>You know what happens when a 5 year-old touches the shell, his tiny, chubby fingers smashing the keyboard, making the shell wonder if it's part of the *infinite monkeys* experiment.

I couldn't possibly refuse.
A chance to head over to MIT instead of rotting here in Albania, giving my soul to the (including, but not limited to), technical illiteracy of the Albanian masses working as a ~~tier-1 slave~~ freelancer and lone sysadmin in an underventilated basement? Why in what's holy not?
<br>I replied, awestruck. I was given a chance to go somewhere and learn something useful. As the thread went on, I got to know another person. Reddit has taught me enough not to give out names *or* relations, so I'm calling this guy Aqif.
He's helping me out with the more specific aspects of choosing what to do with my life. All I can do now is prepare for those choices, one of which is the level 2 math SAT. Considering the fact that there's not much detail in any subject here in Albania, I'll have to do further research.
<br>Easy enough.
<br>The physics teacher has told us about an international physics competition held in Turkey. I have to choose another student, find enough ideas to have something both flashy and innovative (the competition has judges, but the main criterium is the number of people gathering in to be amazed by your otherwordly creation), make that thing, write a description and some presentation riff-raff for the booth, go to Istanbul, prep the booth, hope nothing is broken/missing/delayed/stolen/blown up and sleep only after it's fixed, hope for the best and return.
<br>Tough, but it's team work. Only 2 of us will have to go there, but others can (and probably will) help, at least with the presentation stuff I'm as good as a dead cat at.
<br>The biology teacher expects to have last year's group ready for this year's national competition. It's mostly theoretical excercises, with the "hardest" questions involving hypothetical situations. I'm just not willing to spend my time on it, but that's the kind of teacher who doesn't accept "no" as an answer, not calmly, at least. Guess whose plans will go down the drain.

I don't know if I should just send a site link to my English teacher before due date, or simply post this as if this blog hadn't existed at all.
<br>__Note__:
If you *are* my English teacher, please, for the love of God, please don't show this to the CS teacher. I've shamelessly published an uncompleted webpage with an unfinished theme.
