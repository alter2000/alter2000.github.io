title: Hello hell!
excerpt: What it says on the label
---

Hello peeps, this is my first post with actual content. Since
I don't really know what to write, I'm simply going to publish some
of my homework here. What happens next, I have yet to know. School
started on this lovely 13th, so expect at least a handful of
shenanigans. Until my blank mind decides to fire something up at
me, this blog will only have homework, DIY projects, how-tos
(including this site) and (hopefully) some read-worthy pieces, in
Albanian or English. It seems like a busy year, but something will
eventually come up here. TFTR!
