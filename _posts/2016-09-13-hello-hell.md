Hello peeps, this is my first post with actual content. Since I don't really know what to write, I'm simply going to publish some of my homework here. What happens next, I have yet to know.
School started on this lovely 13th, so expect at least a handful of shenanigans.
Until my blank mind decides to fire something up at me, this blog will only have homework, DIY projects, how-tos (including this site) and (hopefully) some read-worthy pieces, in Albanian or English. It seems like a busy year, but something will eventually come up here.
TFTR!
