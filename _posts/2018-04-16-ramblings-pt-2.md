excerpt: TODOs, roadmaps, preps

I've been asked multiple times about how to make a decent FOSS music server as
minimal as possible, and people are rarely happy when told to RTFM. I have come
to some sort of a conclusion that not all people I talk to have all the
patience in the world to make their tools work as they want them to, or know
how they want them in the first place (mostly the 1337 h4xx0r image many have
from hearing "I use (GNU/)Linux"; I feel this is a bit more than just
a problem, and the fact that I'm a picky prick on what I touch and use doesn't
help, but this isn't quite what I wanted to write about). That's next: setting
up an [MPD] server and installing a client (probably Cantata or MPDroid,
ncmpcpp --- and other TUI apps --- are out of the question), together with
a simple overview of [beets] and [Picard] (both are library managers based on
the [MusicBrainz] database/service).

On the other hand, OSCAL is nearing and I know what I'm talking about out
there, but something needs to be prepped up. I guess this will _probably_ be
_some sort of_ roadmap:

1. Finish with OSCAL and totel
2. Set up a music server
3. `git` the hang of Pandoc
4. TL;DR-ify Ansible during the summer

In the meantime, I'm still fidgeting with Vim to get it to do what I want in
4 keypresses and 1 second at most. I'll definitely show the setup in detail to
get some beginners off the ground, but please don't just copy and paste. Please
