excerpt: and a lot to go on
---

OSCAL is nearly here, the practice exams are almost over with 4 finals to go
and absolutely no goal score in mind, and a fully running website complete with
CD is up for grabs. Life is good. I'm hoping there won't be much walking to be
done, since my left leg has a mind of its own and it doesn't seem to be in the
mood for shuffling about in summer heat. I even have a workshop to yip-yap on
during noon (double time, but there's still a lot to talk about). There's
a camping trip delayed for this week, but there's nothing bribing a Senate
can't do.

I'll have to be extra careful to pick up some spicy project for at least until
June 20th while I'm technically at school not racking up absences (or maybe
not) and devouring bags of sunflower seeds from special places. Until then, ^Z!
