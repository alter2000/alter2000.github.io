excerpt: I feel useless, but that's okay
---

Sometimes I feel like I've stayed where I am for the past year, as if nothing
had changed, not just around me. I still remember everything more as a déjà vu,
than as actual past events. Life is great when I don't have a quantifier, when
past and present flows freely and you don't mind how time flows with it, even
though feelings fleet past, leaving but a husk that, by itself, always feels
alive, until burnt. There's this soft, chilling wind passing by. This should be
life, from what I've been told. Weird; where is _the_ life?

Sure, it's within us. The intestinal flora is a blessing from nature. I'm not
talking about that life, though.

Why does everyone have to do something in order to become someone? Why can't we
have a society free of all prejudice? Would that raise problems when it comes
to interaction? Are those problems bigger than those solved?

I do want to leave this place. I do dream of a decentralized world of plenty.
I still need to feed myself and sleep, though.

Something inside tells me I shouldn't post this kind of content, but that's the
whole point of not bothering to think about the future without no-term goals.
I'm sorry if you, dear reader, had to wade through this, but there's nothing
interesting in here. I don't even think I'll have time for the other parts of
the clickthrough, with all the projects and everything. Now I even have an
opportunity to design a full-fledged e-commerce website, together with everyone
I could gather for the other business parts.

# Why do I have to tell everyone who I am, to define and limit my being to less than 8 bits per piece of information, to pretend to work hard toward paving my path when I know that pavement will be not much more than a distraction to what I will choose to do later?

I think I should just set up a complicated todo folder and break every task
down to dust. I don't know, I think I should probably retry that. _Now what
convention is perfect for this *particular* use case?_
